<h3>More about my hobbies </h3>
<p> My hobbies mainly consist of artistic things which I can do alone at home. I enjoy being alone, but not for too long. When I am not alone I am most likely with my friends.Although I love hanging out with my friends I can not interact withpeople socially due to my crippling anxiety and fear of people.</p>
<br>
<p> One of my main hobbies is art, I enjoy reaseraching reniasance artists and thier lives. I enjoy seeing the impact that they left on the art world. This reaserach on artists such as Vincet Van Gogh inspires new art fpr me tto create which I usually tend to gift to family or friends to be hung up. My beedroom walls are littered with randoem pieces of art I have done when I am bored. The artpieces that I enjoy creating are on many differend medias, sketching with pencil or pen on paper is my simplest form of art howceer the are I do ranges from simple sketching to mixed media paintings/artpeices I also consider some of the sewing I do to be art as what I create most likely isnt a practical peice more than an artistic peice which I enjoy creating. </p>
<h3>Where I grew up</h3>
<p> I grew up in Oratia but a lot of my holidays were spent in Ruakaka (small town up north.) I grew up going out in the bush a lot and exploring new places outside. I would go oto many beaches and forest walks in the Waitakere ranges. Up north in Ruakaka I spent a lot of time at beaches and walking around in nearby neighbourhoods.</p>
